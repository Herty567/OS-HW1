The first part is just text explaining Goroutines and Threads. The second part is run by a Python IDE. When run
there are three libraries used threading, queue, and time. It starts with a shared queue and then a producer function
is made to generate items and put them into the queue. The consumer function takes the items from the queue and
processes them. Then there is the benchmark function that is used to measure the time taken for the producer-consumer
execution. Last part is how the script runs and calls the benchmark function.
